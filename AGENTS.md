### Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. Uniform Buffer Alignment Issue
**Problem**: WGSL requires 16-byte alignment for vec3 in uniforms
```rust
// Before (broken)
struct SimParams {
    dt: f32,
    gravity: [f32; 3],  // Misaligned!
}

// After (fixed)
struct SimParams {
    dt: f32,
    gravity_x: f32,
    gravity_y: f32,
    gravity_z: f32,
    num_bodies: u32,
    _padding: [f32; 3],
}
```

#### 2. Shader Dispatch Bug
**Problem**: Only first 2-3 bodies were animating
```wgsl
// Before (hardcoded limit)
if (idx >= 2u) { return; }

// After (dynamic)
if (idx >= arrayLength(&bodies)) { return; }
```

#### 3. Array Stride Error
**Problem**: `array<f32, 3>` in struct caused alignment issues
```rust
// Solution: Use explicit padding fields
_padding0: f32,
_padding1: f32,
_padding2: f32,
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### GPU Memory Access Patterns
- Coalesced reads: Bodies accessed sequentially by thread ID
- Workgroup size 64: Optimal for warp/wavefront execution
- Memory bandwidth limited, not compute limited

### Performance Optimization Techniques

1. **Memory Layout**
   - AoS for better cache locality per body
   - 16-byte alignment for efficient GPU access
   - Padding to avoid bank conflicts

2. **Compute Dispatch**
   - One thread per body
   - Minimal divergence in shader code
   - Early exit for static bodies

3. **Broad Phase Efficiency**
   - Cell size = 2.5x max object radius
   - Morton encoding considered but not needed
   - Grid cleared each frame (simpler than updates)

### Testing Philosophy

1. **Python Reference First**
   - Every GPU component has Python equivalent
   - Golden data generation for validation
   - Numerical accuracy verification

2. **Property-Based Testing**
   - Hypothesis framework for SDF properties
   - Energy conservation over 1000+ steps
   - Stability under extreme conditions

3. **Stress Testing**
   - 5000 bodies for 30 seconds
   - Extreme velocities and dense packing
   - Memory stability verification

## 📊 Performance Analysis

### Bottleneck Identification
- **Primary**: Memory bandwidth (112 bytes × bodies × 60 FPS)
- **Secondary**: Atomic operations in broad phase
- **Not limiting**: Compute (simple math operations)

### Scaling Characteristics
```
Bodies  | Time/Step | Efficiency
--------|-----------|------------
100     | 0.04ms    | Low (overhead dominated)
1,000   | 0.03ms    | Good
10,000  | 0.04ms    | Excellent
100,000 | 0.16ms    | Memory bound
```

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### Common Issues
1. **Black screen**: Check uniform buffer alignment
2. **No movement**: Verify arrayLength() in shaders
3. **Crashes**: Look for out-of-bounds grid access
4. **Wrong physics**: Compare with Python reference

### Useful Debug Commands
```bash
# Shader compilation errors
RUST_LOG=wgpu=debug cargo run

# Memory validation
cargo test body_size

# Python validation
python3 tests/test_integrator.py
```

## 🚀 Future Optimization Ideas

1. **Memory Layout**
   - Try Structure of Arrays (SoA) for bandwidth
   - Compress quaternions to 3 components
   - Pack shape data more efficiently

2. **Algorithmic**
   - Hierarchical grid for varied object sizes
   - Sweep and prune for 1D broad phase
   - Sleeping/islands for static groups

3. **GPU Features**
   - Mesh shaders for contact generation
   - Ray tracing for continuous collision
   - Tensor cores for batched math

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **WGSL Alignment is Strict**: Always check uniform buffer layouts
2. **Test Early and Often**: Python reference saved debugging time
3. **Profile Don't Guess**: Memory bandwidth was the real limit
4. **Simple Can Be Fast**: Uniform grid outperformed complex alternatives

## 🎯 Phase 2 Preparation Notes

### Tinygrad Integration Considerations
- Need to expose body state as tensors
